This is the code used to power the personnal website of Thomas Julou. It is powered by Jekyll nad hosted on Github page.
The theme is derived from [jekyll-skeleton](https://github.com/awochna/jekyll-skeleton/) (© 2016 Alex Wynter).

## Notes regarding the implementation

- Despite the temptation of fancy available themes, I decided to stick to the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) boilerplate for its minimalism. I followed the recommandation of designing for mobile first and to add media queries for wider screens when necessary.

- In order to be hosted on Github Pages, no user-contributed plugins are allowed. In particular, instead of relying on jekyll-scholar to generate biobliography, I decided to include a slightly modified version of HTML files generated by Zotero.
