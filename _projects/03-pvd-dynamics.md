While interested in the dynamics of siderophore producers and non-producers in spatially structured environments, we discovered that there is a large variability of siderophore abundance between producer cells in a clonal population. We characterised the temporal dynamics of siderophore abundance in details and showed that rapid exchanges between neighbouring cells support the astonishingly large variability.
