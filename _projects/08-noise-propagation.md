Stemming from the observation that regulatory interactions promote gene expression noise ([Wolf, *et al.* 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05856)), these experimental projects focused on how the induction of regulated promoters affects their noise properties, and on the propagation of gene expression noise at the scale of the whole genome in several environments.
