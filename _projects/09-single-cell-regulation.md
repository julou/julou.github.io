We aim at understanding how seamingly coordinated gene regulation behaviours emerge at the population level while the underlying dynamics are instrinsically noisy at the individual level. In particular, we study the induction dynamics of the *lac* operon and of the LexA regulon in *E. coli* at the single-cell level.

**[New preprint out](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.04.894766) on the dynamics of the *lac* operon induction by lactose in *E. coli***: 
we show that although this gene circuit is designed to sense lactose, it actually functions in a regime where most cells have no sensor before induction and hence wait for the next stochastic burst of expression.
