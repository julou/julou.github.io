We aim at understanding how seamingly coordinated gene regulation behaviours emerge at the population level while the underlying dynamics are instrinsically noisy at the individual level. In particular, we study the induction dynamics of the *lac* operon and of the LexA regulon in *E. coli* at the single-cell level.

**[New preprint out](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.03.486858) on the global effect of dilution due to growth on the sensitivity on gene circuits**: we discovered fast growing bacteria require stronger signal to switch on circuits controlled by positive feedback loops, and that growth-arrested bacteria become extremely sensitive to environmental cues.
