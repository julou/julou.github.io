Even in unicellular species such as bacteria and yeasts, systematic effects can be observed as time passes or as cells undergo consecutive divisions. This has been proposed to be a relevant model to study senescence and indeed constitutes a fascinating case of phenotypic variability. I focused on bringing together the knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in increased longevity and the implications of senescence on population dynamics and life history strategies. However, a comprehensive framework is still missing to understand the evolutionary origins and implications of senescence in microbes.
