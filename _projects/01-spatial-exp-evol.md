A sustained attempt to evolve motile bacteria in a double gradient of temperature and nutrients. By maintaining a temperature gradient from 30 to 60ºC and delivering nutrients at the top, we aimed at studying adaptation in a structured environment; since the sensitivity to temperature is a complex trait that depends on the history, this is also a promising setup to study the interplay between physiological acclimation and genetic adaptation. This project was hindered by practical constraints as explained in detailed in my [PhD thesis](http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00600569/). 

If you are interested by this topic, an insightful [article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1203105) on adaptation in a discrete environmental gradient has been published by the lab of Graham Bell.
