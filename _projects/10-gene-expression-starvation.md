We study how bacteria react to starvation at the single-cell level. Stay tuned!

Together with Nathalie Balaban (Hebrew Univ Jerusalem) and Roberto Kolter (Harvard Medical School), we organize a <a href="https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/microbes22">3-weeks workshop on the quantiative biology of non-growing microbes</a> at KITP (UCSB) in October 2022.
