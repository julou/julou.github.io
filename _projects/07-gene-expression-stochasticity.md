We acquire high accuracy datasets of bacteria lineages to characterize the variability of activity of constitutive promoters, and ask questions such as how fluctuations of gene expression couple to fluctuations of cell growth, or how gene expression noise compares between growth and starvation.

In order to address these questions, we develop dedicated inference procedures allowing to compare several models of bacteria physiology and to take measurement noise into account.
