  title: Infection of E. coli by <span class="raw-case">λ</span> phage
  caption: >
    *E. coli* MG1655 is grown in a [DIMM](https://metafluidics.org/devices/dual-input-mother-machine/) chip and infected with 
    fluorescent λ phage (LZ641) after 3 hours. The phase contrast and GFP channels have been overlaid. Frames are acquired every 4 minutes. <br/>
    Experiment: T. Julou, J. Summers (U. Massey), M. Gralka (U.C. Berkeley) during [KITP Summer School of Quantitative 
    Biology 2017](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/qbio/2017-course-description) (strains kindly provided by [L. Zheng](https://zenglab4.tamu.edu)).

  title: Loading of the DIMM microfluidic chip
  caption: >
    *E. coli* cells are loaded in the [DIMM](https://metafluidics.org/devices/dual-input-mother-machine/) chip in several steps: 
    (1) the cell inlet is plugged and its pressure balance the media inlets' pressure, 
    (2) increasing the pressure cell inlet brings more cells to the part of the chip with growth channels, 
    (3) when the flow is stopped (by balancing the pressure again), the cells can swim in the channels. 
    The movie is shown in real time. <br/>
    NB: loading of narrower growth channels can take up to 30 minutes.

  caption: >
    *E. coli* MG1655 expressing a lacZ-GFP fusion is grown in a Mother Machine microfluidic chip with environment control. 
    Glucose and lactose are used alternatively as carbon sources (switching every 4h). The phase contrast and GFP channels 
    have been overlaid. Frames are acquired every 3 minutes; scale bar is 5µm.

  title: Flow control in the DIMM microfluidic chip
  caption: >
    This is a *real-time* close up on the DAW junction of the [DIMM](https://metafluidics.org/devices/dual-input-mother-machine/) chip 
    recorded as fluorescent and non-fluorescent media are flown into the chip with abrupt transitions. The very fast transition 
    (under 1 second) is made possible by using a pressure controller with fast modulation.

  title: <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> newborn cells
  caption: >
    This is primarily an eye candie. Cells are stained with Calcofluor White; the picture shows the maximum intensity projection 
    of a stack acquired in epifluorescence. The absence of bud scars indicate that cells were produced as "buds" at the last division.

  title: <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> newborn cells
  caption: > 
    This is primarily an eye candie. Cells are stained with Calcofluor White; the picture shows the maximum intensity projection 
    of a stack acquired in epifluorescence. This cell displays two bud scars, indicating that it has divided twice since it was a bud itself.

  title: Dynamics and variability of pyoverdin concentration in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (PAO1) microcolonies
  caption: >
    Time-lapse fluorescence images of a growing microcolony, with correlation images (left) and pyoverdin intrinsic fluorescence (right).
    For the fluorescence channel, each frame is normalized by the mean intensity of the image and the inset shows the increase 
    of the mean fluorescence during the experiment. Frames are acquired every 5 minutes; scale bar is 5µm. <br/>

  title: Microbial concentration measurement method based on light scattering by individual cells
  caption: > 
    Dual-view movie obtained with heat-killed E. coli at 7e-6 mL−1 without (left) or with (right) propidium iodide (enhanced online). The upper beam 
    correspond to scattered light wavelength (below 550 nm) while the lower beam correspond to fluorescence wavelength (above 550nm). 
    Acquisition frequency is 3.77Hz and exposure time is 20ms. Contrast has been adjusted to improve particle visibility. Scale bar is 200 μm. <br/>

  title: Collective motion of *E. coli* in dual nutrient and temperature gradients
  caption: >  
    Collective chemotactic motion of *E. coli* RP437 (with a plasmid confering constitutive GFP expression) in a microchannel without (top) or 
    with (bottom) a temperature gradient. After inoculation in M9 medium, bacteria  are centrifugated to the low temperature end after inoculation. 
    Due to their uptake of nutrients, bacteria create a gradient that triggers a chemotactic response visible as a travelling wave. In presence of 
    a temperature gradient reaching lethal temperatures, the chamber colonization is not affected until bacteria reach very high temperature (45.5ºC). 
    Microchannels are 20 mm long × 500 μm high × 100 μm wide. Experiment by T. Julou (LPS, ENS) and J. Saragosti (Institut Curie).
