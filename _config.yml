  I'm a biologist by training, did a PhD in biophysics lab, and currently work on basic research projects. 
  I like to combine different viewpoints in order to phrase new questions. I have a strong commitment to using quantitative approches, and use it to address biological problems involving phenotypic variability. In my daily work, I promote the use of open-source tools and reproducible research practices.
# Quantitative biology of microbes: from gene expression stochasticity to ecology and evolution of bacteria.
