# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm a biologist by training, did a PhD in biophysics lab, and currently work on basic research projects. 
  I have a strong commitment to using quantitative approches, and use it to address biological problems related to phenotypic variability. 
  In my daily work, I promote the use of open-source tools and reproducible research practices.
# Quantitative biology of microbes: from gene expression stochasticity to ecology and evolution of bacteria.
