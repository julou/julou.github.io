## Tools

- a [collection of scripts and configuration files](https://github.com/vanNimwegenLab/MiM_NikonTi) for quantitative light microscopy using [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org).
- a [minimalist R package](https://github.com/julou/ggCustomTJ) to tweak ggplot2 to my taste.
- [MoMA](https://github.com/fjug/MoMA/wiki) a.k.a. the **Mo**ther **M**achine **A**nalyzer, written by [Florian Jug](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research-groups/current-groups/florian-jug/group-leader/) in collaboration with our lab: a state-of-the-art image analysis software to track bacteria growing in microfluidics channels. 
- [DIMM](https://metafluidics.org/devices/dual-input-mother-machine/) a.k.a the **D**ual **I**nput **M**other **M**achine: a microfluidics design for long-term growth and monitoring in precisely controlled environmental conditions.
